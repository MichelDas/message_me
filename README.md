# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version : 5.2.4

* How to run the test suite:
  Just go to the folder with command line and run the rails server and then you can preview from http://localhost:3000/


* Deployment instructions:
  This system can be integrated nearly any system that have user system or want to use user system.
  There is user Login system integrated but the User Registration is not built. So that must be built.
